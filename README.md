# Ocean Navigator

Ocean Navigator is a Data Visualization tool that enables users to discover and view 3D ocean model output quickly and easily.

The ocean model output is stored in [NetCDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) files. These files are self-describing and contain the 2D or 3D model output for one or more timesteps and one or more variables.

To facilitate reading all these files, we make use of a server called [THREDDS Data Server](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/tds/). THREDDS aggregates all the NetCDF files and allows users to query subsets of the files.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DFO-Ocean-Navigator/gh-pages/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
